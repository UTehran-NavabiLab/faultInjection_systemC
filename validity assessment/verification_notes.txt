The goal is to verify fault-simulation result of systemC in comparison to vhdl output using modelsim (with help of TCL script):

- one obvious difference is the way we inject faults on design:
    using TCL in vhdl, faults are injected on signals, forcing any connected net to that signals to get fautly value
        this ensures that more then one gate (whose pin is faulty) get effected hence there is chance that fault being detected with other test Vector

    using fdl method, faults are inject on gates, meaning every fault has effect on one and only one gate no matter what other nets the specifying port 
        is connected to

- one particular observation was that after every fault removal there must be a waiting of at least (one delta cycle) in order
    for injected_signal to be false


verification of fulladder for two method: 
    unequal points have been verified and all match above assumption
